# 👋 Adam Butler — Autherix LLC

**Automation Engineer | Systems Architect | AI + Business Workflow Platforms**

I design and build production-grade automation and AI-enhanced workflows for real operational environments — where reliability, maintainability, and clarity matter more than demos.
I also design and integrate AI-enhanced workflows and systems that augment human decision flows and automate complex pattern extraction.

---

## What I work on
- Workflow orchestration and automation
- API integrations and data pipelines
- Google Workspace automation (Sheets, Apps Script)
- Slack-based internal tools
- System glue between platforms that don’t natively talk
- AI integrations (LLM-powered assistants, automation, and internal tools)

## Tech stack & tools
- Python
- Google Apps Script
- REST APIs
- Webhooks
- OAuth
- scheduler logic
- LLM integrations

---

## AI work
- I build **AI-assisted workflows** that turn messy inputs (emails, Slack, docs, forms) into structured actions.
- Experience integrating **LLM APIs** with strong prompting, structured outputs, and guardrails (validation/redaction).
- I focus on **production reliability**: logging, retries, fallbacks, and cost-aware usage.
- Product: **Autherix AI** → https://autherix.ai

## Exploring next
- **AR/VR + AI** for immersive training, guided workflows, and interactive knowledge systems (early R&D).

## How I think
I care more about:
- **Correctness** than cleverness  
- **Maintainability** than novelty  
- Systems that survive real usage — not just tutorials  

Most of my work solves messy, real-world problems where trade-offs matter and failure modes are real.

## Featured work
### 🔹 autherix-automations
Production-grade business automations including Slack bots, Google Workspace integrations, workflow orchestration, and data pipelines — built for real operational use, not demos.  These include event-driven processes, API orchestration layers, webhook pipelines, scheduled workflows, and modular services designed to handle errors and retries.

This repository reflects **patterns and architectures** I use in client systems. Much of my production work is private, but the approach is the same.

### Example pattern (API → Sheet → Trigger)
1. Ingest JSON data via authenticated API call  
2. Normalize and validate fields  
3. Write to Google Sheet / database  
4. Trigger downstream processes (Slack, notification)

## Web3 identity (exploratory)
I’m exploring **decentralized identity and verification** as a complement to traditional platforms — focusing on identity ownership, verifiable presence, and long-lived digital attribution rather than speculation.

This includes experimenting with ENS-based identity and cryptographic proof concepts as they relate to software authorship and system trust.
