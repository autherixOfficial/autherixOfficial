# 👋 Adam Butler — Autherix LLC

**Automation Engineer | Systems Architect | Business Workflow Platforms**

I design and build **production-grade automation systems** for real operational environments — where reliability, maintainability, and clarity matter more than demos.

---

## What I work on
- Workflow orchestration and automation
- API integrations and data pipelines
- Google Workspace automation (Sheets, Apps Script)
- Slack-based internal tools
- System glue between platforms that don’t natively talk

---

## How I think
I care more about:
- **Correctness** than cleverness  
- **Maintainability** than novelty  
- Systems that survive real usage — not just tutorials  

Most of my work solves messy, real-world problems where trade-offs matter and failure modes are real.

## Featured work
### 🔹 autherix-automations
Production-grade business automations including Slack bots, Google Workspace integrations, workflow orchestration, and data pipelines — built for real operational use, not demos.

This repository reflects **patterns and architectures** I use in client systems. Much of my production work is private, but the approach is the same.
